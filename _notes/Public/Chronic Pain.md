## Chronic Pain Pathophysiology
Four main changes happen in the CNS to propagate chronic pain
### Peripheral Sensitization
Receptive field of each receptor increases and becomes prone to firing

Tissue releases mediators that activate nociceptors. Release from nociceptors causes inflammatory soup that acts as a positive feedback loop.
### Central Sensitization
Transcriptional changes in the dorsal horn result in the nervous system.
NMDA, epinephrine, Norepinephrine, substance P are all relevant players

Allodynia or hyperalgesia are both evidence of the fact that central sensitization has occurred.

Wide dynamic range neurons
### Modulation
inter-neurons coming down from the brain to suppress pain signals start to fail
### Perception
Large number of changes in the brain



## Conversion from Acute to Chronic Pain
~1/5 people will have an episode of chronic pain in their life

#### Factors affecting risk of conversion
- anxiety, trauma, depression
- SES, work environment
- substance use
## Pain Management in [[Opioid Tolerant Patients]] Patients

#### Chronic pain infusion (50 CC syringe)
- Dexmed
    - 50 mcg = 12.5 cc
- Ketamine
    - 50 mg = 1 cc
- Lidocaine
    - 500 mg = 25cc @2%
- Dosage
    - 1cc/10kg/hr + bolus of 1cc/10kg

### Overview
Patients presenting with baseline pain may have added challenges during the #Perioperative period.
[[Multimodal Analgesia]] is a good option for these patients to minimize intra-operative and post-operative opioid usage.
	
	
## Approach to Treating Chronic Pain
Consider which channels and receptors should be blocked
