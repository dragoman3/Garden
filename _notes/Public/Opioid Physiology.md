# Opioid Physiology

## Notes

Mechanism (lange 10)

## Receptor subtypes
   #### $\mu_1$
   Supraspinal analgesia, euphroria, bradycardia, hypothermia, urinary retention
   #### $\mu_2$
   respiratory depression
   #### $\kappa$ 
   Sedation
   miosis
   diuresis
   spinal analgesia
   #### $\delta$
   analgesia
   behavioural
   epileptogenic
   #### sigma
   hallucinations
   dysphoria
   respiratory stimulation
## Receptor physiology
  G - coupled receptor causing membrane hyperpolarization →  Inhibition of adenylyl cyclase → 
  Physiologically, endorphins, enkephalins, dynorphins, endogenous peptides bind these receptors
  Opioid receptor activation increases K conduciton in presynaptic membrans causing neuronal hyperpolarization
 Inhibits neurotransmitter release (ACh, Dopamine, NE, substance P)

Largely, the site of action of any delivered opioid is in the spinal cord and brain.

## Pharmacology

Hepatic metabolism is the primary route of elimination

majority of inactive metabolites are excreted in urine

- Exceptions
    - Morphine 6 glucoronidase
        - slightly active, renally excreted. Can accumulate in renal failure and lead to opioid effects
    - Hydromorphone
        - One metabolite has neuro-excititory effects
    - Remifentanil
        - Tissue plasma-esterase metabolism. Not worried about end organ

## Solubility:

Opioids in general are lipid soluble. They are converted to water soluble

## Multisystem effects

All side effects gain tolerance except for GI constipation

- CNS
- Respiratory
    - brainstem activation of ____
- Cardiac

Dosages:

Almost all opioids IV doses can be multiplied by 2-3 to get the equivalent PO dose.

Beware of *cross tolerance,* leading to decreased tolerance when switching between opioids. Reduce dosage by ~1/2 

B

### Morphine
![[Morphine#Summary]]
### Hydromorphone

- 5x more potent than morphine
- Neuroexcitatory metabolites, theoretical concern in seizure disorders  [^1]
- Starting dose  0.5-1mg IV q4 hrs
- Onset ~5 minutes, duration 3-4hrs

### Fentanyl

- 100x more potent than morphine
- Hepatic metabolism
- Starting dose 25-50 mcg IV PRN q5min
- Onset 3-5 minutes, Duration 30 min

### Remifentanil
- 100x more potent than morphine (similar to Fentanyl)
- Hoffmann elimination (no organ dependant metabolism)
- Dose 0.5-1 mcg/kg IV 
- Onset 1-2 minutes, Duration 3-5 minutes

### Codeine

- prodrug of morphine whose analgesic effects depend on metabolic conversion to morphine
- No need for triplicate prescription

### Tramadol

- Complex mechanism on opioid receptors, norepinephrine and serotonin reuptake
- Pros: reduced opioid side effects, post-op ileus, respiratory depression,
- Cons: prodrug, expensive, associate with SS, high doses increase risk of seizures

### Percocet

Oxycodone-acetaminophen

Oxycodone is 1.5-2x as potent as morphine

- starting dose 5-10 mg po q4

## Opioid Conversion
PO Morphine to IV Morphine -> 3:1
Neuraxial Morphine to IV Morphine -> 2.5mg: 20mg (over 24 hrs)
- think about delivering epimorph at the end of a Cesarean Section 
Morphine conversions:
#highyield 
3:10:10:10
# Example

5 mg IV q4 morphine. Converting to oral HM

```objectivec
5x6 = 30mg morphine daily
30mg/ day morphine  = 6 mg HM daily
3mg q12hr
```
