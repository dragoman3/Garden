### [[Post-Dural Puncture Headache]]
- Features
    - Positional (improved laying)
    - cranial nerve features
    - temporally related to spinal
- Treatment
    - Expectant
        - analgesia
        - fluid status
        - drink coffee
    - Interventions
        - Cosyntropin
        - Sphenopalatine ganglion block
        - Blood patch

            First attempt → 80% likely to suceed

            Second attempt 90% likely

## Intrathecal Opioids
- Strong evidence for the addition of **both** short-acting (fentanyl) and long-acting (morphine, 'EpiMorph') 
- Fentanyl injected intrathecally (10-15mcg) is associated with decreased need for supplemental intraoperative analgesia during a c-section (NNT = 4), decreased nausea/vomiting (NNT = 6.5), longer time to post-op analgesia [^1]
- No difference was noted with respect to hypotension, onset of block, or degree of block [^1]
- There is an increase in pruritus w/ intrathecal fentanyl (NNH = 13.5) [^1]
- Similarly, intrathecal morphine has shown to provide effective analgesia up to 48 hours post-operatively [^2]
- Optimal dosing varies but evidence suggests that 100-150 mcg (0.2-0.3cc of 5mg/mL EpiMorph) is likely optimal (balance between analgesia & side effect, namely pruritus) [^3]

## Side Effects
### Nausea/Vomiting
- Thought to be secondary to relative cerebral hypoperfusion secondary to decreased MAP (sympathectomy & venodilation)
- Treat BP if hypotensive 
- Anti-emetics
	- Ondansetron is a good choice as quick onset, good rescue drug
	- Metoclopramide has excellent evidence in obstetrical population (NNT 3-4) [^4]
### Common Side Effects
- Vasodilation/hypotension
    - Pre-treat with phenylephrine
    - First sign normally nausea vomiting
- Bradycardia
    - DDx includes sympathectomy, vagal maneuvers, other effects
- High spinal
    - Test handgrips to assess cervical motor function (diaphragm C345, grip is lower than that)
## Common Dosage Regime
1.8 mL 7.5 % bupivicaine (hyperbaric) = 1.8mL x 7.5 mg/ml = 13.5 mg
10 mcg of fentanyl = 0.2 mL of fentanyl
0.1 mg epidural morphine
![[Bupivicaine#Bupivacaine toxic dose]]
## Post-operative Monitoring
Beware of biphasic morphine respiratory depression
epidural morphine → q1 hour for 12 hours then q2hr x 12 hrs.
## Contraindications
