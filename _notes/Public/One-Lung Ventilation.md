# One-Lung Ventilation
Created on 2021-10-07
See [[422 Lung Reduction Surgery]], [[202.8 Dynamic Hyperinflation]]

## Indications
#### Protective Ventilation
- infection
- lavage
- trauma
#### Surgical Isolation
- VATS
- Triple A
- Pneumonectomy / Lobectomy
#### Control of Ventilation Distribution
- [[202.12 Bronchopleural Fistula]]/ cutaneous fistula
- bullous disease
- trauma
### Indications for DLT
> Pathology related
#### Indications for R sided DLT (0.1% of the time, very uncommon)
> Anything happening on the L side (not always)

- L lung transplant
- L pneumonectomy
### Indications for Bronchial Blockers
> Procedurally challenging situations

- nasotracheal intubation
- difficult airway
- limited MO
###  Indications for either
> Optimization of surgical procedure itself
## Contraindications (mostly relative)
- dependence on both lungs
- bronchial blockers may still be an option
- Severe hypoxia
- hemodynamic unstable
- Severe pHTN
- Suspected difficult intubation
## Physiology of One-Lung Ventilation
Positioning of patient has big impacts:  [[111.1 Lateral Decubitus Position]] [^1]

### Factors Affecting Blood Distribution
A number of protective factors are in place to prevent hypoxia
Gravity causes increased flow through dependent lung

[[202.7 Hypoxic Vasoconstriction]]  

Surgical compression also may affect blood flow
Pathologic states may affect redistribution of blood.
Increased PAP (from COPD) and atelectasis can limit blood flow redistribution

Because oxygen doesn't transport across the membrane as fast as CO2, OLV is mostly a problem of hypoxia (See [[202.2 Gas Transport]])

### Open Chest
Mediastinal weight -> increases elastance (decrease compliance) to dependent lung
No isolation -> PPV will cause herniation into surgical field

## Anesthetic Management of One-Lung Ventilation

### Initiation of OLV
Place DLT or bronchial blocker, confirm placement
Pre-oxygenated with FiO2 of 100%
Mixing in air to the inspired gas prior to initiating OLV may help reduce the [[202.5 Atelectasis#Resorption Atelectasis | Resorption Atelectasis]] (not recommended at AHD)
Alveolar recruitment after changes in position or initiation
VC hold at 30cmH20 for 20-30 s
TLV 6-8 ml/kg ideal body weight
PEEP 3-10 cmH2O
### Maintenance
Classical teaching: TV with two lung vent, ZEEP, high FiO2 -> lots of resp failure post op
Today:
- FiO2 40-80 % (watch for bleomycin). As low as possible
	- [[One-Lung Ventilation#Avoiding Hyperoxia]]
- PEEP 5-10
- TV 4-6 ml/kg consider 6-8 if severe hypercapnia, hypoxia
- RR 12-15 (permissive hypercapnea)
- I:E normal unless obstructive
- PCV - less risk of high inspiratory pressures with surgical manipulation
#### Avoiding Hyperoxia
- ROS, ischemic reperfusion injury
#### Recruitment Maneuvers
Can be disruptive to the surgery, stimulating, cause coughing. Ensure paralysis. 
Can do gently recruitment with increasing tidal volumes
### Monitoring
CAS monitors
Arterial line
Spirometry (built in)
+/- TEE


## Intra-operative Considerations
### Lung not deflating
Ensure tube at same depth, adequate blockage
Check cuffs (should be to atmosphere)
Trial of suction
Insert bronchoscope and look for plugging, blockage

### Hypoxemia
10% of OLV patients
Predictors:
- previous contralateral resection
- supine
- normal FEV1
- Poor O2 on two lungs
- High A-a
- Right sided surgery

Clarification of below paper. Switching to TIVA is *helpful*

## Extubating OLV
Re-expanding lung slowly
- Reduced risk of ALI, PTX
- improves hemodynamics
- protects anastomosis

Manipulating cuffs when patient is *light* can be very stimulating. Ensure good secretion clearance.
