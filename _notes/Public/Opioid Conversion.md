## PCA
See [[Patient Controlled Analgesia (PCA)]] for more info. 

## Converting from ER/Contin to IR dosing
- ER/Contin are simply dosed at different timepoints (less frequent) but they are equivalent with respect to the total daily dose
- Converting between them is the same
- One caveat being that **you cannot crush** an ER/Contin tablet as it will convert to the same dose but as an IR

## Methadone Use
- Methadone is a synthetic opioid ogonist & NMDA antagonist
- Indicated for opioid dependence / chronic pain
- Half life 15-40 hours
- Administered once daily
- 15-30mg starting dose increased to 80-100mg depending on need
- Has been shown to reduce dependance, usage, overdose etc. 
- Methadone (or buprenorphine) maintenance therapy does **NOT **provide analgesia (tid or qid dosing can provide analgesia but NOT daily)

1) Assess utilization
	- Reason for use (substance use disorder, chronic pain etc)
	- Type, timing of last dose, daily dose etc.
	- Assess comorbidities, physical exam for overdose vs. withdrawal symptoms 
2) Investigations
	- CBC, lytes, liver/kidney function
	- Not recommended to order ECG on everyone using methadone

3) Assess anesthetic options
	- Opioid free regional anesthesia + baseline maintenance methadone is **gold-standard** in these patients
	- If not an option, proper opioid dosing is necessary and it is important not to undertreat their pain

4) Continuing maintenance Methadone
- If can take PO then ok 
- If unable PO intake you can order IM or SQ at 2/3 the maintenance dose divided into 2-4 equal doses per day 
- If not available can convert to other forms of opioids (this is TRICKY as it is not bidirectional and can vary widely by dose)
- In general Methadone PO to Morphine PO ratio **1 : 4.7 ** (then decrease by 25% for cross tolerance)
