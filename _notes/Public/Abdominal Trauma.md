# Abdominal Trauma
Created on 2021-09-15

#### Regions of Abdomen
![[Pasted image 20210914223235.png | 300]]
##### Pelvic cavity
Contains rectum, bladder, iliac, internal reproductive organs.
### Blunt injuries
Includes direct blows, shearing injuries, deceleration injuries
Most commonly injured:
- Spleen (40-55%)
- Liver (35-45%)
- Small bowel
*The liver and spleen are both mobile organs fixed by their sites of attachments*

#### Lap seat belt
- bucket handle tear of bowel
- iliac artery/aortic thrombosis
- pancreas / duodenal injury
- rupture of sm bowel or colon
#### Shoulder harness
- upper abdo viscera injury
- intimal tear or thrombosis of innominate, carotid, vertebral, subclav,
- rib #
- Cervical spine fractur
#### Air bag
- Face and eye abrasion
- cardiac injury
- spine fracture
### Penetrating Injury
Stab wounds often involve the liver, small bowel, diaphragm, colon
Gunshots hit the small bowel, colon, liver, vascular structures
### Blast
incorporate penetrating and blunt mechanisms.
Overpressure injuries to tympanic membranes, lung, bowel


## Patient examination
### History
Evaluate for urgent issues requiring 
#### MVA 
![[Pasted image 20210915151833.png | 250]]

#### Fall
height
#### Penetrating Trauma
- time of injury
- type of weapon, distance, number of wounds
- amount of bleeding
#### Explosion
- distance
- enclosed?
- underwater
- secondary impact and projectiles

### Pelvis stability
> total blood loss in pelvic fracture is up to 2L

Further findings include ruptured urethra (scrotal hematoma, blood in penis meatus), limb length discrepancy, rotational deformity of leg without obvious deformity
Do not test mechanically in a hemodynamically unstable patient if the signs above are present

Place pelvic binder immediately
Palpate for bony tenderness, do not assess for stability if hemodynamically unstable.

### Hypotensive patients
rapidly identify injuries that cause hypotension

### Hemodynamically normal patients
evaluate for peritonitis
if no peritonitis, complete a more detailed exam to find issues that can cause delayed bleeding
> repeat exam often

Abnormal bowel sounds may not be abnormality
Try to distinguish deep vs superficial tenderness
**Involuntary guarding** *is* a reliable method of peritonitis
Estimate fetal age
### Back examination
log roll patient

### Hypothermia prevention
Cover patient with blankets after this

### Urethral & perineal rectal examination
Urethral injury signs -> blood at meatus, scrotal/perineal ecchymosis
Rectal exam (in blunt trauma)-> sphincter tone, mucosal integrity
Rectal exam (penetrating) -> look for gross blood/ tone
### Vaginal exam
if laceration or penetrating injury suspected

### X-rays
May help find sources of blood loss
Alert, awake patients with no pain does not need this
Hemodynamically normal, with penetrating trauma near the diaphragm can help
Clip all entrance and exit wounds prior to XR

### [[FAST Exam]]

Repeat if necessary
### DPL
[[117.18 Diagnostic Peritoneal Lavage]]
### CT scan
> Do not allow this to delay transport

Hemodynamically normal patients.
Relative contraindications
- uncooperative patient
- allergy

CT can miss diaphragm, GI, pancreatic injuries
Free air suggests small injury to GI tract
## Management
### Pelvic Fracture
Hemmorhage control:
- emergent -> stabilization with binder at level of greater trochanter
- externally rotate the hemipelvis, internal rotation of lower extremity [^1]
- Definitive-> angio procedure, operative repair
> Transfer early

#### Binder application
- log roll patient
- apply sheet or pelvic binder at level of greater trochanter
- repeat pelvic XR once applied
#### Summary

### Gastric tube
Goal is to reduce dilation, decompress stomach
Can prevent aspiration but also trigger comitting
**Blood** can indicate esophageal or upper GI injury
Don't place NG if basilar skull fracture or facial fracture
### Urinary catheter
- monitor UO, decompress bladder
- Do FAST first
- watch for gross hematuria

### Solid organ injuies
#### Hemodynamically unstable
immediate laparotomy
#### Hemodynamically stable
admit to hospital and watch the patient
## Indications for Laparotomy in Blunt Trauma

## Indications for Laparotomy in Penetrating Trauma

### Diaphragm injuries
Left more common than right
CXR may show blurring 
Confirm with laparotomy, thoracotomy, laparoscopy, thoracosctomy
