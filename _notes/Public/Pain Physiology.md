### Nociception
Tissue trauma releases mediators
 - H+, K+, histamine, serotonin, arachadonic acid

These substances activate the nociceptors (free ends of small pain nerve)
## Pain fibers
Often pseudo unipolar

### A-delta
Lightly myelinated
carry mechanical stimulus and *cold* temperature
Pinprick
Allows precise localization of pain
### C fiber
Unmyelinated and transmission is slwo
Heat, chemicals, pressure are transmitted
### A-Beta
Pressure sensation is transmitted but not 

## Spinal Tracts
### Dorsal Column
### Spinothalamic tracts
3 different tracts
We are concerned mostly with the neospinalthalamic 

## Somatosensory Cortex

## Differential Blockade
Manifested by differences in the extent of cephalad blockade of temperature, discrimination,  and vasomotor tone.
Temperature and vascomotor tone are blocked to the greatest extent
Motor function is blocked to the least extent. These facts are due to the various fibers of transmission (See [[#Nerve Fiber Transmission]])
