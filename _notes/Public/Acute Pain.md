## WHO Analgesic Ladder

Comment on CR:

- often this is preventing opioid withdrawal
## Perioperative Pain

### Gabapentinoids
See [[verretPerioperativeUseGabapentinoids2020]]
### Opioids

### Acute Neuraxial Analgesia
CAS have single guideline on this topic
## Acute on Chronic Pain
See [[Chronic Pain]] #ChronicPain 
Taken from Barash - 55.
### Pre-operative
1. Evaluate and recognize high risk status
2. Identify factors (dosage, previous surgery) that may put risk if poorly controlled pain
3. Formal detailed consultation.
4. Reassure patient and discuss options
5. Calculate opioid usage at baseline
### Intra-operative
1. Maintain baseline dose of opioids.
2. Increased intraoperative opioid dose
3. Heavily consider peripheral blockade
4. Use non-opioid analgesics
### Post-operative
1. Plan for adequate post-op strategy
	- document plan and backup plan
2. Maintain post-op opioiods
3. Opioid alternatives continue post-op
4. Consider PCA
5. Consider Neuraxial opioids
### Discharge planning
1. Create a long term taper of opioids.
2. Timely outpatient pain physician follow-up
